# Overview

TiP BoF stands for "Testing in Python, Birds of a Feather."

TiP BoF was started in 2009 by a few members of the Testing in Python mailing list. The idea was to go out to dinner, but then turned into ordering pizza and giving lightning talks about testing and Python. 

What started as a very small, core group of testing hackers poking fun at each other's projects and idiosyncrasies in 2009 eventually imploded on itself at PyCon in Santa Clara 2013.  

TiP BoF as a PyCon event hasn't happened since. 

# The Rules

# The Lessons

- TiP BoF always created an alternate venue for ideas at PyCon. 
    - As PyCon has grown over the years, the competition to give talks, tutorials and lightning talks is at an all time high. 
    - TiP BoF was always a place where an individual could bring up an idea, thought or talk and have an audience to listen and react. 

- TiP BoF can be a tough crowd, and that's the current downside that needs to be worked on. By 2013, everyone in a 300 person crowd felt like they could heckle a speaker - and that shouldn't be the case. 

# The Challenge

- How do you still provide "something for people to see," but limit the amount of audience engagement?
