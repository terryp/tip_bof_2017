## Open 

Good evening! Good evening! Good evening!

My name is Terry Peppers. I'm the Vice President of Engineering at Leapfrog.  We're a marketing technology company based in Evanston, IL. 

Welcome to the 2017 Testing in Python Birds of a Feather, or if you're into the whole brevity thing TiP BoF! 


## The Beginning

The first TiP BoF was at PyCon 2009 in Chicago when a very small and very niche mailing list called "Testing in Python," decided to get together and meet one another in real life and talk about our thoughts on testing. 

It started innocently. I bought beer. Paul Hildebrandt bought pizza. We found a room with a projector. And we just started talking and giving presentations. 

It was the most ordinary and least magical thing on the surface.

For me, personally, this was the single most transformative event that I've ever had in the Python community. It was at this first event that I connected deeply with a group of individuals. And collectively we spoke in a single voice that was witty, intelligent, irreverent, approchable, standoffish and - most importantly - never took itself seriously. 

Before this, most of the people that I knew @ PyCon were email addresses, source repositories, authors of books, Twitter handles or API's; they weren't people that I connected too. But after this I made friends and I came away with a deeper understanding of the community that I admire and love. 


## The Middle and "The End"

Each successive year after 2009 was filled with it's own foibles. 

2010 was the year of the Testing Goat. 

2011 was the year we started arm stretching with Feihong Hsu before lightning talks; it was also the year that Bryan Veloso brought a lab coat that didn't fit anyone. 

2012 was when it first started to feel like it wasn't going to scale anymore - people only came to heckle not participate. 

And 2013, the last time we had the TiP BoF, ended poorly. No one remembers the great talks, but rather they remember the behavior that ruined the evening. 


## Tonight's the Night

So here we are tonight. 

We're going to try it again. 

I hope this works and I'm relying on you - the community that I'm apart of and so very proud of - to help me. It takes a ton of courage to come up here and talk. And not only that, but talk about something as mundane as testing. And while we know that the heckle is part of the BoF - let's remember to treat everyone with respect and grace. 


## The Rules

The rules, for first-timers. 

1. Be Ready.
2. Speak Loudly.
3. You Have 5 Minutes - ish. 
4. The Talk Has to Be About "Testing."
5. You Don't Have to Take Questions. 
6. Be Nice. We're in "code of conduct" territory. 
7. Best Lighting Talk of the Evening Wins the Lab Coat.*

*Unscientifically judged by me and some of my friends. 


## Thank You

And a couple of really important thank yous. 

1. Kenneth Reitz / This wasn't my idea, this was Kenneth's idea. So I'd like everyone to thank him. Not only is his a prolific Python developer, but he was really the driving force behind organizing this. 

2. Heroku / Yep, we have a sponsor. Thank you Heroku. Special shout outs to Natalie and Cynthia. 

3. Python Software Foundation / Thank you for not kicking me out. Thank you Brandon and Ewa for being supportive and for all your help to make this happen.

4. McMenamin's Crystal Ballroom / MICK-MAN-NI-MINS / Thank you Betsy for this awesome venue. 

5. My Team / Thank you to my team for helping out this evening. Joel, Kevin, Eric, Jamie, Zoe, Chris, Alana, Joseph ... you are appreciated. 

6. My Friends / Thank you to all of my friends for coming. I love this conference because of Python, yes, but because I get to see all of you. 

7. You / Thank you for coming and making this happen. Thank you for being supportive of the notion of testing. But most importantly, thank you for teaching me more about myself. We are incredibly lucky for this great community that we are a part of. 

And now ... now ... let's get on with the show.

## Boneyard

The notions of expression, liberty, wit, improvisation, irreverence, high technical skill

This gathering of testers started very innocently. The inital group of attendees was less than 30 people, but we really connected with one another. We found a collective voice. We admired each others attitudes and projects. We both loved and hated everything about testing. And most of all, we didn't take ourselves very seriously. 

I think it was these ideas of expression, liberty, wit, improvisation, irreverance coupled with deep technical skill with a nod to articulateness that changed the way I thought about Python and the Python community. 

Each successive year from 2009 until 2013, the TiP BoF grew from 30 people to a couple of hundred people. And each year, the same core group of individuals kept coming and participating in this gathering. 

It was in these years that we saw a massive explosion in attendance. I specifically remember in 2009 being surprised at how many people showed up. - Atlanta 2010, specifically - that I conjured up this idea of a Testing Goat. Bryan Veloso who was at GitHub at the time brought this crazy lab coat that everyone wore. 

Great things happened -
